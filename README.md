Well, that's what I call it. Couldn't come up with a better name. Anyways, this script works with selenium and chrome webdriver.

> 0.9 releases were made in gists. Which are no longer supported.

For running it, you should have python3 and latest version of Chrome webdriver downloaded. It'll be better if you have selenium preinstalled. However, installation of sellenium has been taken care of in the script.

If you're on linux, you should run [linux] script.
- Download [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.45/chromedriver_win32.zip)
- Clone the [script](https://github.com/evi1haxor/atm_wa.git)

Now if you don't have default system settings for storing downloads, then you should specify the complete path (as illustrated below) where the downloads gets stored in your system.

```bash
python3 atm_T/linux/main.py -p "THE\\PATH" -c *** -m "THE MESSAGE"
```



<sub>_Replace `***`Â with your target counts._</sub> <br>

If you've never touched your system settings, you can simply execute the command without `-p` flag ExampleGiven-

```bash
python3 atm_T/linux/main.py -c *** -m "THE MESSAGE"
```
