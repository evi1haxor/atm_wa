Well, that's what I call it. Couldn't come up with a better name. Anyways, this script works with selenium and chrome webdriver.

> 0.9 releases were made in gists. Which are no longer supported.

For running it, you should have python3 and latest version of Chrome webdriver downloaded. It'll be better if you have selenium preinstalled. However, installation of sellenium has been taken care of in the script.
